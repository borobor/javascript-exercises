# Exercise 04 - removeFromArray

Implement a function that takes an array and some other arguments then removes the other arguments from that array:

```javascript
removeFromArray([1, 2, 3, 4], 3); // should remove 3 and return [1,2,4]
```

## Hints

The first test on this one is fairly easy, but there are a few things to think about(or google) here for the later tests:

- how to remove a single element from an array
- how to deal with multiple optional arguments in a javascript function
- [Check this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments).  Scroll down to the bit about `Array.from` or the spread operator. - [Or this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters).
 
 
 ## UPDATE AFTER FINISHING:
 
 Spent a lot of time solving this but to no avail :( so finally decided to look at the solution.
 1. I misunderstood the problem; I should be more when thinking what is the task actually.
 2. In the solution they used .forEach() and .filter() methods which I haven't used before so using them now was definitely a challenge.
