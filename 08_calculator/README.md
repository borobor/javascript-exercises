# Exercise 08 - Calculator

The goal for this exercise is to create a calculator that does the following:

add, subtract, get the sum, multiply, get the power, and find the factorial

In order to do this please fill out each function with your solution. Make sure to return the value so you can test it in Jest! To see the expected value
take a look at the spec file that houses the Jest test cases.

# This was fun!

I tried multiple solutions with some functions. E.g. `function sum(arr)` was done using the `.reduce()` method which is the preffered way nowadays as shown in the code, but the same results can be achieved using a `for` loop or `.forEach()` method!
